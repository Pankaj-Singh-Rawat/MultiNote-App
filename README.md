# 📝 MultiNote  

A simple and clean Android notes app built with **Kotlin**, **Room Database**, and **MVVM architecture**.  
Create, edit, auto-save, and organize your notes with ease.  

---

## 🚀 Features (so far)

- **Create Notes** → Add a title and content with instant auto-save.  
- **Auto-Save** → Notes are saved automatically as you type (no save button needed).  
- **Edit Notes** → Tap a note card to open and edit it.  
- **Delete Notes** → Swipe right on a note card to delete it (with **Undo** via Snackbar).  
- **RecyclerView Grid** → Notes displayed in a neat 2-column grid layout.  
- **Empty State** → Shows a message when no notes exist.

## ⚡ How It Works

- **Room** manages persistent storage.  
- **LiveData + ViewModel** keep UI in sync with database changes.  
- **Coroutines** handle background operations.  
- **AutoSave**: A debounce mechanism ensures efficient updates while typing.
